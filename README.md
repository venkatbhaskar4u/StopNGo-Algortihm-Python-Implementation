# StopNGo Algorithm Python Implementation

This GitHub repository contains a Python implementation of the StopNGo algorithm. The StopNGo algorithm is a heuristic-based approach used for solving optimization problems related to traffic signal control and signal timing.

## Description

The StopNGo algorithm aims to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion at intersections by dynamically adjusting signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions. This algorithm considers various factors such as traffic volume, vehicle queues, and delays to determine the optimal signal timing plan.

The implementation in this repository provides a Python codebase that demonstrates the StopNGo algorithm's functionality and its application in traffic signal control. It offers a flexible framework that can be customized for specific intersections and traffic scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Traffic Simulation**: The implementation includes a traffic simulation environment that emulates the movement of vehicles through an intersection. This simulation allows for testing and evaluating the performance of the StopNGo algorithm under different traffic scenarios.

- **Dynamic Signal Timing**: The StopNGo algorithm dynamically adjusts signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions. It optimizes traffic flow by minimizing vehicle delays, reducing queue lengths, and improving overall intersection efficiency.

- **Heuristic Optimization**: The algorithm utilizes heuristic optimization techniques to find near-optimal signal timings. It considers factors such as vehicle queues, traffic volume, and signal phasing to generate an optimal timing plan.

- **Performance Evaluation**: The implementation provides mechanisms to evaluate the performance of the StopNGo algorithm. It includes metrics such as average vehicle delay, queue length, and throughput, allowing for a quantitative assessment of the algorithm's effectiveness.

- **Visualization**: The implementation offers visualization capabilities to depict the traffic flow, signal timings, and the algorithm's decision-making process. This visualization aids in understanding the algorithm's behavior and assessing its performance visually.
